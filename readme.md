# Meebleeps Freaq FM Synth
## Arduino Synth with Dual-voice 2-OP FM | Generative 2-track Polymetric Sequencer | Mozzi SDK

My second Arduino project is an evolution of my first Mozzi synth build, with dual 2-op FM voices running on a 2-track generative polymetric sequencer built to sync & fit with a  Volca collection.

Started simple but ended up cramming the 32K Flash to the brim with features and wavetables, and maxxed out the interface with obscure button combinations, but it makes lots of funky noises now!

## Voices

-   2 independent FM voices
-   2-operator FM (for old-school prince of persia vibes! ðŸ˜‚)
-   Multi-mode FM ratios - quantised, free-multiple, independent
-   Multiple carrier waveforms - Sine, Saw, Reverse Saw, Square, Noise
-   Modulation depth controlled by Envelope (attack-release) and LFO per voice
-   Multiple LFO waveforms (using same tables as the carrier oscillators) Sine, Saw, Reverse Saw, Square, Noise

## Sequencer

-   2/1.5 track polymetric sequencer with up to 16 steps per track (Both tracks use same note sequence but can have different step-counts for polymetric phasing)
-   Multiple generative algorithms - (semi)random notes, (semi)random runs, arpeggio, drone 
-   Sequence mutates/evolves at user-defined rate & note-density
-   Selectable tonic, octave & scale quantisation (Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Phrygian (GOA!), Octaves, Fifths)
-   Tap-tempo control
-   Sync input & output (Korg Volca compatible) 
-   16-step parameter-lock recording of synth parameters (the Elektron way!)

## Hardware 
-   Arduino Nano (Elegoo) 
-   Simple Mozzi output circuit 
-   Added power filtering caps on DC input and 5V rail
-   Designed to fit into Volca form factor 
-   Laser-cut metalisized acrylic faceplate 
-   Laser-cut wooden enclosure 
-   7V-12DC DC Power input 
-   Access to nano's USB port for firmware upgrades 

## User Guide

### Buttons

-   Tonic - Select tonic through natural notes A - G
-   [Func] + Tonic - Shift base octave from 0 - 5
-   [Func][Rec] + Tonic - Select octave offset to Track 1 (track 1 & 2 can be 0-4 octaves apart)

-   Scales - Select current musical scale
-   [Func] + Scales - Select current generative algorithm
-   [Func][Rec] + Scales - Select Carrier Waveform for the current voice 

-   Rec + knob - Hold down while moving a knob to record those parameters to the sequence 
-   [Func][Rec] + knob - Hold down while moving a knob to delete the recorded sequence for that parameter 
-   [Func][Rec] + buttons - Access various secondary functions

-   Start - Start or stop the sequencer
-   [Func] + Start - Tap tempo

-   Voice - Select the active track which can be edited using the parameter inputs
-   [Func] + Voice - Select the FM ratio mode for the current voice
-   [Func][Rec] + Voice - Select the LFO waveform for the current voice 

### Rotary Inputs

-   Mutation - Adjust the likelihood that the sequence will change over time
-   [Func] + Mutation - Adjust the liklihood that any given step will be a note or a rest

-   Population - Adjust the number of steps for the active track
-   [Func] + Population - Adjust the number of steps for all tracks

-   Lifespan - Adjust the length of the notes (for all tracks)

-   Ratio - Select the carrier--to-modulator FM ratio (based on the current FM mode)

-   Wobble - Adjust the amount of LFO to apply to the modulator level for the active track
-   [Func] + Wobble - Adjust the LFO rate for the active track

-   Attack - Adjust the attack time for the modulator level envelope

-   Decay - Adjust the decay time for the modulator level envelope

-   Depth - Adjust the amount of envelope to apply to the modulator level for the active track

## Issues / Limitations

-   Fair bit of jitter in the sequencer timing when tracking external sync due to somewhat naive approach to the 2-step-per-pulse volca sync 
-   Mozzi audio library has 10ms buffer
