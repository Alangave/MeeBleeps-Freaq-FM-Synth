# Meebleeps Freaq FM Synth
## Arduino Synth with Dual-voice 2OP FM | Generative 2-track Polymetric Sequencer | Mozzi SDK

My second Arduino project is an evolution of my first Mozzi synth build.  This time with dual 2-op FM voices running on a 2-track generative polymetric sequencer built to sync & fit with my Volca collection.

## Voices

-   2 independent FM voices
-   2-operator FM (for old-school prince of persia vibes! ðŸ˜‚)
-   Multi-mode modulator-operator ratios - quantised, free-multiple, or independent
-   Modulation depth controlled by Envelope (attack-release) and LFO per voice

## Sequencer

-   2/1.5 track polymetric sequencer with up to 16 steps per track (Both tracks use same note sequence but can have different step-counts for polymetric phasing)
-   Multiple generative algorithms - (semi)random notes, (semi)random runs, arpeggio
-   Sequence mutates/evolves at user-defined rate &* note-density
-   Selectable tonic, octave & scale quantisation (Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Phrygian (GOA!), Octaves, Fifths)
-   Tap-tempo control
-   Sync input & output (Korg Volca compatible) 
-   16-step parameter-lock recording of synth parameters (the Elektron way!)
